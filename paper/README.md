# Paper Documentation

This directory contains research papers, academic publications, and technical documentation related to the vision-research project.

## Purpose

The `paper/` directory serves as a centralized knowledge base for:
- Theoretical foundations of computer vision algorithms
- State-of-the-art object detection methodologies
- Underwater vision research and challenges
- AUV autonomous navigation systems
- Related academic publications and literature reviews

## Directory Structure (will apply for further research)

```
paper/
├── object_detection/       # Papers on object detection algorithms (YOLO, R-CNN, etc.)
├── underwater_vision/      # Research on underwater computer vision challenges
└── autonomous_systems/     # AUV autonomy and navigation papers
```

## Organization Guidelines

### File Naming Convention
- Use descriptive names: `yolov8_architecture_2023.pdf`
- Include year in filename when applicable
- Use underscores instead of spaces

### Recommended Categories (will apply for further research)

1. **Object Detection**
   - YOLO family papers (v5, v7, v8, v9)
   - Detection transformers (DETR, etc.)
   - Real-time detection algorithms

2. **Underwater Vision**
   - Image enhancement techniques
   - Color correction underwater
   - Turbidity and visibility challenges
   - Marine object detection datasets

3. **Autonomous Systems**
   - Path planning algorithms
   - Visual SLAM
   - Sensor fusion
   - Navigation strategies

## How to Use

1. **Adding New Papers**: Place papers in appropriate subdirectories
2. **Citation Management**: Consider creating a `citations.bib` file for BibTeX references
3. **Notes**: Create markdown notes summarizing key findings from papers

## Useful Resources
