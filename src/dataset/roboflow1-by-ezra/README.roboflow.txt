The dataset includes 1379 images.
Gate are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)
* Auto-contrast via contrast stretching

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.02 percent of pixels
